Frames, Bones, and Sprites may all be "synced" to a parent, meaning that when the parent is changed,
its children may also be modified automatically. Not all information should be synced, so this document
will attempt to catalog the intended syncing behavior. There are two types of syncing: automatic 
syncing, which happens when a property is changed, and Manual Resyncing.

The user may call a "Manual Resync" on any of these node types, which will sync all data (except ID) AND call a 
Manual Resync on any of its children. This effectively makes the node identical to its sync node.

Frames:
No frame properties should automatically sync.

Manual Resync - Call a Manual Resync on all child bones


Bones:
Name - Should always change the name of all child bones when the name of the parent is changed.
Position/Rotation - Should not change normally, should copied during a manual resync
Parent Bone - Should be automatically synced

Manual Resync - Sync all data + Manually Resync all child Sprites


Sprites:
